}
```

Happy loggin' üìù

## Environment variables

This plugin has access to four environment variables, but only one them is required for the logger to work properly.

#### ‚úî All API calls are sent to the database running inside the docker container
The environment variable `USAGE_LOGGERS_URL` stores this address, which by default should be the string `"http://localhost:7701/message"`
#### ‚úî All API calls are filtered using a set of rules (Optional)
The environment variable `USAGE_LOGGERS_RULES` stores these [logging rules](#protecting-user-privacy) as a string. Even though this variable is optional, it is recommended to set it to `"include debug"` or `"allow_http_url"` when trying the plugin for the first time.
#### ‚úî Reponse bodies are logged up to a certain size (Optional)
If you are working with large response payloads and don't want to log the whole thing, you can use the environment variable `USAGE_LOGGERS_LIMIT`. It stores an integer value corresponding to the number of bytes after which a response body will not be logged (by default, this upper limit is 1 MiB).
#### ‚úî The Logger can be disabled even if the plugin is enabled (Optional)
By setting the environment variable `USAGE_LOGGERS_DISABLE` to `true` the logger will be disabled and no API calls will be logged.

## Manual installation

- Clone this repo inside:
  - **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Insomnia/plugins/`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Insomnia\plugins\`
  - **Linux**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Insomnia/plugins/ or ~/.config/Insomnia/plugins/`
- Install dependencies using `npm i`

## Protecting User Privacy

Loggers always have an active set of <a href="https://resurface.io/logging-rules">rules</a> that control what data is logged
and how sensitive data is masked. All of the examples above apply a predefined set of rules (`include debug`),
but logging rules are easily customized to meet the needs of any application.
